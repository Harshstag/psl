      A wedding planner is a professional who assists with the design, planning
      and management of a client's wedding. Weddings are significant events in
      people's lives and as such, couples are often willing to spend
      considerable amount of money to ensure that their weddings are
      well-organized. Wedding planners are often used by couples who work long
      hours and have little spare time available for sourcing and managing
      wedding venues and wedding suppliers.
